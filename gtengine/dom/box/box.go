// Package box deals with typesetting boxes.
//
/*
Typesetting may be understood as the process of placing boxes within
larger boxes. The smallest type of box is a glyph, i.e. a printable
letter. The largest type of box is a page -- or even a book, where
page-boxes are placed into.

The box model is very versatile. Nevertheless we will generalize the
notion of a box to mean the bounding box of a polygon. Typesetting in
irregular shapes is a feature available in most modern systems, e.g.
when letting text flow around a non-rectangular illustration.

This module deals with rectangular boxes, starting at the glyph level.
The notation oftentimes follows the one introduced by the TeX typesetting
system.
