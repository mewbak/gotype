I'm afraid I need some sort of value in order to continue,
so I've tentatively inserted `0'. You may want to
delete this zero and insert something else;
see Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.

I've just read as much of that statement as I could fathom,
so a semicolon should have been next. It's very puzzling...
but I'll try to get myself back together, by ignoring
everything up to the next `;'. Please insert a semicolon
now in front of anything that you don't want me to delete.

The expression shown above has the wrong type,
so I can't transform anything using it.
Proceed, and I'll omit the transformation.
