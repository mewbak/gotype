Package styled is a straightforward default implementation of style.StyledNode.

Status

This is a very first draft. Please be patient.

Overview

We strive to separate content from presentation. In typesetting, this is
probably an impossible claim, but we'll try anyway. Presentation
is governed with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS uses a box model more
complex than TeX's, which is well described here:

   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model

If you think about it: a typesetter using the HTML/CSS box model is
effectively a browser with output type PDF.
Browsers are large and complex pieces of code, a fact that implies that
we should seek out where to reduce complexity.

A good explanation of styling may be found in
