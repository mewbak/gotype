### Excerpt: 
> "In this paper, I argue that HTML5 offers unique advantages to authors and publishers in comparison to both traditional word processing and desktop publishing tools like Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign, as well as other markup vocabularies like DocBook and AsciiDoc. I also consider the drawbacks currently inherent in the HTML5 standard with respect to representing long-form, structured text content, and the challenges O’Reilly has faced in adopting the standard as the new source format for its toolchain. Finally, I discuss how O’Reilly has surmounted these challenges by developing HTMLBook, a new open, HTML5-based XML standard expressly designed for the authoring and production of both print and digital book content."
