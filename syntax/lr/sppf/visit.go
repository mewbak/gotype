/*
Traversing a parse forest resulting from an ambiguous grammar in practice
mainly come in two variants:

- The choice of parse tree is irrelevant. An example for this is determining
  the result of an arithmetic expression, ignoring associativity: 1+2+3=5,
  independently of associativity.

- The client has additional knowledge of how to prune the parse forest and
  select one tree. Using again the example from above: selecting the tree
  representing left-associativity would result in the pruning of 1+(2+3),
  leaving (1+2)+3 as the un-ambiguous parse-tree.

Many heavily grammars can be invented (and often are for tests and for
research), but real-world clients most of the time have a clear understanding
of how strings for a given grammar are supposed to be structured. It is more
a problem of communicating this easily to a parser.

The focus of this package is therefore, to enable the user to prune ambiguous
parse trees, without making silent descicions which cannot be influenced by
the user. That means: having sensible defaults, but provide options for the
advanced user.
